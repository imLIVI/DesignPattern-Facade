# DesignPattern-Facade
## Binary Facade
### Description
In this task, we will practice with the ```Facade``` template. You need to write a simple facade class to a set of standard java classes that will be able to do two things:
1. add and
2. multiply numbers in binary notation.

As a result, the user will be able to perform these two operations through just one method call of your class, and not through an independent call of a combination of standard
java methods. Demonstrate performance in the ```Main``` class.
